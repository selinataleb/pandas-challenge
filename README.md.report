The goal of the PyCitySchools analysis was to look at different measures of school success across the district. By looking at data about students, we were able to find important metrics like average test scores, passing rates, and overall student success. The study was divided into several parts, such as performance across the whole district, performance at each school, and performance broken down by spending, school size, and school type. 
We saw that schools with fewer than 1,000 kids had the best average math and reading scores and the highest passing rates. For instance, 89.88% of students in small schools passed, while only 58.29% of students in big schools (2000â€“5000 students) did. This can be due to a more inclusive learning environment, maybe a better student-teacher ratio too. 
Another observation I made was that schools that spent less on each student had better passing rates and average scores. For Example, he overall passing rate for schools spending less than $585 per student was 90.37%, while the overall passing rate for schools spending between $645 and $680 was only 53.53%. This could mean that schools with smaller budgets are using their ressources more efficiently and that they might have non-monetary factors that are contributing to high performance of students.
